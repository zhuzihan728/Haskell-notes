functional language
write functions to process data

no state changes (no variable only name for data)


infix function: 
prefix functiion: 
succ 4   == 4+1, succ has higher priority than *
cons: add an element to the head of a list

lost comprehension 从后向前翻译
tuple vs list:
tuple is fixed, can have data of different types.
when one crestes a tuple, it has a unique type.


type:
Int
Float
Double
Bool
Char
[一个type就好]
(type，type，type，type)

x :: y == x has type of y

typeclasses: defines behaviors of a function.
